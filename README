Please review the demonstration site here:
http://emberex.com/hashrouter

The site includes documentation, tutorials, and examples.

This repository contains the entire demonstration and documentation site for easy reference. This repository therefore also contains copies of jquery, jquery history, jquery ui etc. It is highly recommended that you download these separately from their respective sources.
