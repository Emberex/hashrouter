	<h2>Bookmarking</h2>

	<p>With HashRouter every action has an associated URL, and every URL can be loaded directly.</p>

	<p>Users can bookmark specific sub-pages, layouts, or table sorts that are in the URL.</p>

	<p>Try bookmarking or manually typing in these links. Of course you can simply use your back button to return to this page.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="##page:backButton/sort:Fruit/direction:up/">Sort by Fruit, Up</a></li>
		<li><a href="##page:backButton/sort:Student/direction:down/">Sort by Student, Down</a></li>
	</ul>
